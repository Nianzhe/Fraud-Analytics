# Fraud-Analytics
The purpose of this Application (Identify) Fraud project is to look for anomalies among records of “application data” file using a real time fraud algorithm (supervised models) normally applied to deal with identity fraud. Our goal is to build and tune a model that has the highest FDR (fraud detection rate) when examining 3% of the record population. And we believe such a model will help find out the optimal division point to target suspicious applications from a business perspective.

The original data set represents product application data from 2016-01-01 to 2016-12-31, contains 1,000,000 records and has 10 fields describing the details of the application, like application date, ssn, address, name, zip code and date of birth of the applicant. Among all the fields, 8 fields are categorical variables, 1 field is date, and 1 field is index.
